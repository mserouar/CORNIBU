## Description
The present study relies on a newly developed maize architectural model coupled with the Caribu algorithm (Chelle and Andrieu, 1998), the latter including ray-tracing and nested radiosity methods to simulate light regime over 3D scenes. 

The architectural model, detailed along given code/functions, coupled with the Caribu algorithm is called CORNIBU, and is publicly accessible via : https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168169924010858?ref=pdf_download&fr=RR-2&rr=93e7dc8d99740d80

CORNIBU -contraction of Corn-Caribu (Chelle et al. 1998)- allows to simulate the 3D architectural canopy structure of maize plants and renders light interception.

Allow wireframe in Mesh #1 panel

Then play with vmax value to calibrate color map/scale : Note if you do want to normalize [0;1] set norm argument of function to "y"

If plot interactive diplay issues : downgrade your widget notebook in VS Code : pip install -U ipywidgets==7.7.1

# Key Content
The present study/model relies on a newly developed maize architectural model coupled with the Caribu algorithm (Chelle and Andrieu, 1998), the latter including ray-tracing and nested radiosity methods to simulate light regime over 3D scenes. The architectural model is detailed along the following publication : **Identifying maize architectural ideotypes through 3D structural model validated in the field: Assessing the impact of plant architecture and sowing pattern to improve canopy light regime.** https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2024.109694

The maize 3D architecture model used in this study simulates different structural characteristics of maize plants: leaves shape and dimensions, leaves inclination and curvature, insertion height and plant/leaves orientation. Compared to previous models (Fournier and Andrieu, 1998, Espa√±a et al., 1998, L√≥pez-Lozano et al., 2007), this new one presents a good compromise between details in describing architectural characteristics (like leaves orientation, not sufficiently considered in previous models) while keeping a reduced number of input variables accessible from field measurements.

A whole complete sensitivity analysis concerning the CORNIBU accuracy -faced to actual maize hybrids in fields- is available in the given paper.
Briefly, digital canopies of five maize hybrids grown under different sowing patterns in Southwest France field trial were validated by comparing computed and actual daily ùëìùêºùëÉùê¥ùëÖ values, and showed a satisfactory fit (ùëÖ¬≤ ‚àº 0.6).
Even moren than 0.6, actually, based on not yet published works.

# Known issues

This model was tested on linux (several times, Ubuntu versions, etc...) and MacOS.

Under MacOS, please use this type of command in bash to create env or install packages in it.
```python
CONDA_SUBDIR=osx-64 conda install openalea.plantgl openalea.deploy openalea.visualea -c fredboudon -c conda-forge
```
Also, concerning resolution : how much final mesh is realistic | Depending of number of facets.
MacOS may have difficulties rendering in Web-based display. Increase number of given line in 'loop_all_leaves,py' function to deal with.
